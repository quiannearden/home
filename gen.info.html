			<h2> RAM </h2>
			<p> 
				RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is the type of memory that can be accessed randomly without the preceding bytes.RAM has a high storage capacity which ranges from 64 megabytes to 16 gigabytes.
				It is a volatile memory that stores the data until the computer is on once the computer is turned off the data that has been stored will be erased. It is a read-write memory of the computer. 
				RAM falls into the category of storage.

			</p>
			
			<h3> ROM </h3>
			<p>
				ROM stands for, Read-Only Memory. It is a memory containing hardwired instructions that the computer uses when it boots up, before the system software loads. 
				Just like RAM the Random Access Memory (ROM) also has the data storage capacity however it is a non-volatile memory which means that even if the computer power is 
				turned off the data will be stored permanently when the computer is turned on. 
				The data in ROM can only be read by the CPU (Central Processing Unit). When compared to RAM it has smaller storage capacity and it is slower. 
			</p>
			
			<h4> CACHE </h4>
			<p>
				The cache is a program that helps speed up the working system of a computer.
				When the computer is being used by a user, the cache memory stores the information program that have been used frequently, for example,
				if I have used the website Code Hs frequently be going back to it by deleting the tab and visiting again or just moving from one tab to the other this cache memory is storing the data while the process is going on with the user and the computer.
				When accessing the instruction quickly it increases the speed of the software program on the computer. Cache falls into the group of storage which temporarily stores the data and that can be fetched easily.

			<h6> RAM </h6>
			<h7> Pros </h7>
			<ul> 
				<li> The CPU can read the data faster. </li>
				<li> No moving Parts. </li>
				<li> It can write and erase operations. </li>
				<li> It increase the speed of the computer. </li>
			</ul>	
			<h8> CONS </h8>
			<ul>
				<li> It is volatile, which you can't store a data or information, permanently. </li>
			</ul>
			<h9> PRICE </h9>
			<p>The RAM is very expensive, because it is easier to read than any other storage devices. </p>
				
			<h10> ROM </h10>
			<h11> Pros </h11>
			<ul>
				<li> The data can be stored permanently,compared to RAM.</li>
				<li> Non-volatile</li>
				<li> Circuits are simple. </li>
			</ul>
			<h12> CONS </h12>
			<p> ROM can read only unlike RAM. </p>
			
			<h13> PRICE </h13>
			<p> ROM is cheaper than  other devices. </p> 
			
			<h14> CACHE </h14>
			<h15> Pros </h15>
			<ul>
				<li> The data is ready when you use the application. </li>
				<li> Cache memory is saved by going to temoporarily file. </li>
			<ul> 
			
			
			
			<p>
				When choosing the RAM for your device, you need to consider a few things to get the right one. Firstly, you need to make sure that the RAM is suitable for the motherboard. 
				Secondly, you need to consider the amount of speed it has and the capacity of the memory that can be held in it. In the future, we think that the world will use flash for high-speed memory for data storage instead of RAM.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When picking the ROM for your device, you need to know the following. You have to select the ROM which has the latest  version and that is compatible with your device so that you can get a better storage capacity and speed. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Cache memory is small and is located near the CPU or the motherboard so that it can read and write instructions and this memory is quicker than a normal RAM, however, Cache memory has a lower capacity.
				The cache cannot be chosen for the device because itâ€™s already a part of the hard drive on the computer. Thinking about it, the hypothesis we make is that the future trend of Cache memory is that it will be more expensive to increase
				the capacity and the speed would be much faster than now.
