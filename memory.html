			Computer memory is any  device that can store information, data,files, images or audio,permanently or temporarily.
			like ROM (read-only memory). Memory devices utilize integrated circuits and are employed by operating systems, software, and hardware.
			Memory is not a disk storage. A memory is like a human brain, it is used to store data, or information.
			Data Storage is usually considered future , while memory is usually described as short term.

	<h3> History </h3>
			
		
			
		<p>
			The evolution of memory began many years ago with a humble invention; the punched card .
			Invented within the 19th century by Hollerith , who would continue to be a founding father of IBM, paper punch machines were at one point churning out up to 10 million punch cards every day .
			Punch cards were the primary effort at Data Storage during a machine language. Punch cards were wont to communicate information to equipment “before” computers were developed.
			In 1837, a touch over 100 years later, Charles Babbage proposed the Analytical Engine, a primitive calculator with moving parts.
			Hollerith developed this concept , and made the Analytical Engine a reality by having the holes represent, not just a sequence of instructions, but stored data the machine could read.
			within the 1960s, “magnetic storage” gradually replaced punch cards because the primary means for data storage. mag tape was first patented in 1928, by Fritz Pfleumer.
			within the past, the terms “Data Storage” and “memory” were often used interchangeably. However, at the present , Data Storage is an umbrella phrase that has memory.
			Data Storage is usually considered future , while memory is usually described as short term.

	<h4> Vacuum Tubes for Random Access Memory </h4>
		<p>
			In 1948, Professor Fredrick Williams, developed “the first” Random Access Memory  for storing frequently used programming instructions.
			Data in RAM sometimes called volatile memory is temporary and when a computer loses power, the info is lost, and sometimes frustratingly irretrievable. 
			ROM or Read Only Memory, on the opposite hand, is permanently written and remains available after a computer has lost power.

	<h5> Magnetic Core, Twistor & Bubble Memory </h5>
		<p>
			In the late 1940s, core memory was developed, and patented, and over ten years, became the first way early computers wrote, read, and stored data.
			In 1953, MIT purchased the patent, and developed the primary computer to use this technology, called the Whirlwind. 
			However, manufacturing them was difficult and time consuming.
			The Twistor Magnetic Memory was invented in 1957 by Andrew Bobeck. It creates computer memories using very fine magnetic wires interwoven with current-carrying wire.
			The Twistor Memory concept led Mr. Bobeck to develop another short-lived magnetic memory technology within the 1980’s, referred to as Bubble Memory. 
			Bubble memory may be a thin magnetic film using small magnetized areas which appear as if bubbles.

	<h6> Semiconductor Memory </h6>
		<p>
				
			In 1966, the newly formed Intel Corporation began selling a semiconductor chip with 2,000 bits of memory. A semiconductor memory chip stores data in a small circuit referred to as a memory cell. 
			Memory cells are made up of miniaturized transistors and/or miniaturized capacitors, which act as on/off switches.

	<h7> Magnetic Disk Storage </h7>
		<p>
			Magnetic drums were the primary incarnation of magnetic disc storage it was  developed by Gustav Taushek, an Austrian inventor,  in 1932.
			IBM is primarily liable for driving the first evolution of magnetic disc storage. They invented both the diskette drive and therefore the hard disc drive and their staff are credited with many of the improvements supporting the products.
			IBM developed and made disk storage devices between 1956 to 2003, then sold its “hard disk” business to Hitachi in 2003.
			A diskette is an easily removed (and easily installed) portable memory device .
		</p>
			
			
				
		<p>
			In 1976, Allan Shugart improved on IBM’s diskette , by developing a smaller version of it. this is often because IBM’s 8-inch diskette was too big for a typical personal computer .
			The new 5.25-inch diskette was cheaper to manufacture and will store 110 kilobytes of knowledge .
			The 3.5-inch floppy disc (introduced in 1982) gradually became more popular than the 5.25-inch diskette .

	<h8> Optical Discs </h8>
		<p>
			recIn the 1960s, an inventor named James T. Russel considered , and worked on, the thought of using light as a mechanism to ord, then replay “music.”
			This was when Sony paid Russel many dollars to end his project. This investment led to his completing the project in 1980, successively resulting in CDs (Compact Discs) and DVDs (Digital Video Recordings) and Blu-Ray. 
			The word “disk” is employed for magnetic recordings, while “disc” is employed for
			optical recordings. IBM, preferred the “k” spelling, but in 1979, Sony, and a Dutch company named Philips, preferred to use the “c” spelling in developing and trademarking the compact disk .

	<h9> Flash Drives </h9>
		<p>
			Flash drives appeared on the market, late within the year 2000. A flash drive plugs into computers with a built-in USB plug, making it alittle , easily removable, very portable memory device .
			Unlike a standard disk drive , or an optical drive, it's no moving parts, but instead combines chips and transistors for max functionality. Generally, a flash drives storage capacity ranges from 8 to 64 GB.
			
			
				
	<h10> Solid State Drives </h10>
		<p>
			An SSD may be a non-volatile storage device that basically does everything a tough drive will do. It stores data on interlinked non-volatile storage chips.
			The memory chips can either be a part of the system’s motherboard or a separate box that's designed and wired to plug into a laptop, or a desktop disk drive .
			SSDs “can” be portable, but won't slot in your pocket.

	<h11> Cloud Data Storage </h11>
		<p>
			The Internet made the Cloud available as a service. Improvements within the web , like continuously lowering the value of storage capacity and improved bandwidth, have made it more economical for people and businesses to use the Cloud for data storage.
			The Cloud offers essentially an infinite amount of knowledge storage to its user. Cloud services provide near-infinite scalability, and accessibility to data from anywhere, at anytime. is usually wont to backup information initially stored on site, making it available should the company’s own system suffer a failure.
			Cloud security may be a significant concern among users, and repair providers have built security systems, like encryption and authentication, into the services they supply .

		<p>
			The development of RAM technologies are magneto - resistive RAM ( MRAM), resistive RAM ( ReRAM) and phase transition RAM (PCRAM).
			Additionally a replacement sort of memory has been introduced which may make RAM and ROM obsolete. it's capable of doing a far better job than RAM and ROM. 
			This research is completed by the scientist shanghai’s Fudan University. It allows you to make a decision how long you would like the memory to carry the info
